This directory contains sets of common templates that can be shared
between projects. This way, only those templates that differ between
projects need to be specified in the project's own templates directory.

The settings.py in your project should add the desired templates
directory (only 'default' for now) to TEMPLATE_DIRS after the entry
for your project-specific templates. e.g.

    TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
        os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "templates"),
        os.path.join(PINAX_ROOT, "templates", "default"),
    )
