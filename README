pinax: a platform for rapidly developing websites
http://pinaxproject.com/

Pinax is an open-source collection of re-usable apps for the Django Web
Framework.

By integrating numerous reusable Django apps to take care of the things
that many sites have in common, it lets you focus on what makes your
site different.

While our initial development is focused around a demo social
networking site, we are also working on number of editions tailored to
intranets, learning management, software project management and more.

If you have any questions about the Pinax project, please contact
James Tauber <jtauber@jtauber.com> or join us on the #pinax IRC channel
on freenode.
