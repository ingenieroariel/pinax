django-notification
===================

Many sites need to notify users when certain events have occurred and to allow
configurable options as to how those notifications are to be received.

The project aims to provide a Django app for this sort of functionality. This
includes:

 * Submission of notification messages by other apps.
 * Notification messages on signing in.
 * Notification messages via email (configurable by user).
 * Notification messages via feed.
