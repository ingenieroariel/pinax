Serving Ajax Validation With Your Static Media Server
=====================================================

By default, if you use the template tag included with Ajax Validation, the 
script will be placed inside HTML <script> tags and served up this way.  This is 
usually fine for development, however for production it is reccomended you serve 
Ajax Validation with your seperate static media server.

To do this you should copy the ``jquery-ajax-validation.js`` file from 
``ajax_validation/static/js/`` and put it somewhere in the directory structure 
where the rest of your site's static media is.  You should then replace all 
instances of ``{% include_validation %}`` with::
    
    <script type="text/javascript" src="PATH_TO_FILE_HERE"></script>

where ``PATH_TO_FILE_HERE`` is the location your media server is serving the 
file from.
