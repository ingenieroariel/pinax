Installing django-oembed
========================

Thanks for downloading django-oembed!

To install it, first use subversion to check out the source code::

    svn checkout http://django-oembed.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-oembed

Now, link the included ``oembed`` directory to your pythonpath.  On Debian 
variants, it would look something like this::

    sudo ln -s `pwd`/django-oembed/oembed /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/

To use it with a Django installation, first place 'oembed' in the INSTALLED_APPS
tuple of your settings.py file like so::
    
    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # ...
        'oembed',
    )

Then syncdb, and here is sample usage in a template::

    {% load oembed_tags %}
    {% oembed %}
        {% for link in links %}{{ link.href }}{% endfor %}
    {% endoembed %}
    
In the previous example, any link.href would be replaced with an OEmbed-fetched
embed.

The templatetag takes one optional second argument, which you can figure out by
looking at this usage::
    
    {% oembed 320x240 %}

Note that this application requires Python 2.3 or later, and Django later than
0.96. You can obtain Python from http://www.python.org/ and Django from 
http://www.djangoproject.com/.
