0.5.1
=====

The 0.5.1 release brings various bug fixes and more stability to Pinax. We have fixed some
bugs and improved the documentation. This release should be backward compatible, except
where noted.


Python 2.4 support
------------------

0.5.1 brings Python 2.4 compatibility. There are still many distributions out there that
have Python 2.4 as the default Python version.


Removal of Pownce support
-------------------------

Pownce closed their doors on December 15, 2008 after being bought by Six Apart. There is no
longer any reason we should support Pownce.

You may need to remove some Pownce bits from your templates if you forked from the
``complete_project`` locally.
