Introduction
============

Pinax is an open-source collection of re-usable apps for the `Django Web Framework`_.

By integrating numerous reusable Django apps to take care of the things that many sites have in common, it lets you focus on what makes your site different.

While our initial development is focused around a social networking site, Cloud27_, we are also working on number of editions tailored to intranets, learning management, software project management and more.

Features

At this stage, there is:

- openid support
- email verification
- password management
- site announcements
- a notification framework
- user-to-user messaging
- friend invitation (both internal and external to the site)
- a basic twitter clone
- oembed support
- gravatar support
- interest groups (called tribes)
- projects with basic task and issue management
- threaded discussions
- wikis with multiple markup support
- blogging
