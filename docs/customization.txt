Customization
=============

As more sites are built using Pinax, more best practices will emerge, but for
now what we recommend is:

- Choose which :ref:`project <ref-project>` you would like to use as a starting 
  point.
- Copy that project into a directory outside of the subversion checkout.
- Make any necessary changes to your ``manage.py``, ``deployment/*.wsgi`` etc 
  in that copied project directory to reflect the location of your Pinax 
  checkout.  The most important variable to change in those files is 
  ``PINAX_ROOT``.
- Make necessary changes to the ``settings.py`` and ``urls.py`` files in your
  copied directory.
- Develop your custom apps there.
- Develop your own templates there.

Choosing a Project
------------------

By default, Pinax provides two projects to use as a starting point for 
customization.  Depending on your development style, you may prefer one project 
over the other.

basic_project
    This project comes with the bare minimum set of applications and templates
    to get you started.  It includes no extra tabs--only the profile and notices 
    tabs are included by default. From here you can add any extra functionality 
    and applications that you would like.

complete_project
    This project comes fully-featured, with everything that Pinax provides
    enabled by default.  It provides all tabs available, etc.  From here you can
    remove applications that you do not want to use, and add your own 
    applications as well.

Settings You Will (Probably) Want To Override
---------------------------------------------

- ``DEBUG``
- ``TEMPLATE_DEBUG``
- ``LOGGING_OUTPUT_ENABLED``
- ``ADMINS``
- ``MANAGERS``
- ``DATABASE_ENGINE``
- ``DATABASE_NAME``
- ``DATABASE_USER``
- ``DATABASE_PASSWORD``
- ``DATABASE_HOST``
- ``DATABASE_PORT``
- ``TIME_ZONE``
- ``SECRET_KEY``
- ``DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL``
- ``SERVER_EMAIL``
- ``MAILER_PAUSE_SEND``
- ``SEND_BROKEN_LINK_EMAILS``
- ``EMAIL_HOST``
- ``EMAIL_PORT``
- ``EMAIL_HOST_USER``
- ``EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD``
- ``EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX``
- ``EMAIL_DEBUG``
- ``CONTACT_EMAIL``
- ``URCHIN_ID``
- ``BBAUTH_APP_ID``
- ``BBAUTH_SHARED_SECRET``
- ``SITE_NAME``

All but ``MAILER_PAUSE_SEND``, ``CONTACT_EMAIL``, ``URCHIN_ID``,
``BBAUTH_APP_ID``, ``BBAUTH_SHARED_SECRET`` and ``SITE_NAME`` are just the
standard Django settings.
